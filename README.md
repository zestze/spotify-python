# Spotify client to grab Discover Playlists - in Python

# needs to register a user,
# with a token or something. Authenticate?

# to do this, need a "loopback" address, and so a flask server might help.

# then, need to send requests to spotify, with the authentication token,
# upon receiving the data, send it to the database.

# need to figure out how to do this stuff...
